I googled the percent of Americans that go to college and this website https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/analysis/2021/07/01/how-many-americans-have-college-degrees/#:~:text=Nearly%2094%20million%2C%20or%2042,percentage%20of%20college%2Ddegree%20holders. said it is 42% for adults over 25. If you think about high school and learning with the context that more than half will not be attending college within the next 7 years then you might rethink what is the most important concepts to read about in primary school. I also personally think students are much more capable of experiencing difficult concepts earlier than you think. That is one of the benefits of reading challenging concepts is that you have a safe place and time to process the information. By high school students in the US have read the Giver, which has child euthanasia and have learned about the holocaust in depth. I think Beloved would fall under age appropriate if you give high school students a little more credit.

      "> But an equally basic passion of mine ab initio was for myth (not allegory!) and for fairy-story, and above all for heroic legend on the brink of fairy-tale and history, of which there is far too little in the world (accessible to me) for my appetite. I was an undergraduate before thought and experience revealed to me that these were not divergent interests – opposite poles of science and romance – but integrally related. I am not 'learned' in the matters of myth and fairy-story (Though I have thought about them a good deal), however, for in such things (as far as known to me) I have always been seeking material, things of a certain tone and air, and not simple knowledge. Also – and here I hope I shall not sound absurd – I was from early days grieved by the poverty of my own beloved country: it had no stories of its own (bound up with its tongue and soil), not of the quality that I sought, and found (as an ingredient) in legends of other lands. There was Greek, and Celtic, and Romance, Germanic, Scandinavian, and Finnish (which greatly affected me); but nothing English, save impoverished chap-book stuff. Of course there was and is all the Arthurian world, but powerful as it is, it is imperfectly naturalized, associated with the soil of Britain but not with English; and does not replace what I felt to be missing.
